NAME
    RT::Action::SetPriorityFromHeader - Set ticket priority from an email
    header of your choosing

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run the first time you install this action.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Action::SetPriorityFromHeader));

        or add "RT::Extension::SetPriorityFromHeader" to your existing
        @Plugins line.

        You also need to configure the email header to use and a mapping
        from the email header values to RT priority values.

            Set($PriorityHeader, 'X-Priority');
            Set(%PriorityMap, highest => 1, high => 2, normal => 3, low => 4, lowest => 5);
            # With the above, a header like "X-Priority: high" would set the RT ticket priority to 2
